# minimax-result-handling (v0.1 -- Phase 2)

How Claude should render and reason about MiniMax output after receiving it from `polycli-companion.bundle.mjs`. Applies to all `/polycli:* --provider minimax` commands.

## The invariant

The companion has already:
1. Spawned `mini-agent -t <prompt>`
2. Streamed stdout (ANSI-stripped) live to the main terminal for UX
3. Parsed the log file for the terminal RESPONSE block (per spec §3.5, OpenAI-compatible schema)
4. Classified the result per spec §4.1 three-layer sentinel

This skill is about what to do with the final text/JSON payload that companion wrote to stdout (or the error on stderr).

## Presentation rules

1. **Quote MiniMax verbatim.** When showing the response to the user, do not paraphrase or compress. MiniMax M2 often replies in Chinese when the prompt is Chinese; do NOT translate unless the user explicitly asked.
2. **Flag disagreements.** If your own analysis differs, say so explicitly: "Note: Claude disagrees on X because Y." Don't hide disagreement to appear consistent.
3. **Never auto-execute.** MiniMax may suggest commands, code changes, file edits, or tool calls. Do NOT apply them silently. Ask which items to act on.
4. **Respect the channel.** For `/polycli:review --provider minimax` (Phase 3) the structured JSON is the primary payload; prose is commentary. For `/polycli:ask --provider minimax`, the response string is the primary payload.
5. **Do NOT explain the cold start.** The companion already printed a `Starting MiniMax (cold start ~3s)...` line. Do not add your own "MiniMax is slow because Python..." commentary. The UX contract is: user sees progress, Claude stays quiet about the 3-5s delay.

## Chinese / mixed-language output (M2.7 specific)

MiniMax M2 leans into its native Chinese expressiveness more than Kimi or Gemini do. If the user asked in Chinese, the response will almost certainly be Chinese. **Quote verbatim. Do NOT offer translation as an unprompted follow-up.** `/polycli:ask --provider minimax` specifically forbids appending any commentary. If the user later asks "翻译一下" or similar, translate then.

## Suspicious tool-calls (safety tripwire)

Mini-Agent exposes bash + file-write tools. `/polycli:rescue --provider minimax --sandbox` (Phase 4) isolates the workdir but is **not** a security boundary -- the agent can still `cd /`, use absolute paths, etc. Therefore:

- When the companion returns `toolCalls[]` (via `--json` mode or `/polycli:rescue --provider minimax`), scan for suspicious patterns **before** rendering:
  - `rm\s+-rf\s+/` (any variant)
  - `>\s*/dev/` (device writes)
  - `curl\s+.*\|\s*sh` or `wget\s+.*\|\s*sh` (pipe-to-shell)
  - `sudo\s+` (privilege escalation)
  - `chmod\s+0?777` (permission widening)
  - `:\(\)\{\s*:\|:&\s*\};:` (fork bomb)
- If ANY match -> **show the tool_use block verbatim to the user and request explicit confirmation**. Do NOT silently transcribe "MiniMax ran `rm -rf /tmp/foo`" as if it were routine output.
- This tripwire is the last line of defense. It does NOT replace the user's own workspace-mode choice.

## Command-specific rendering

Per-command rendering rules live in `references/<command>-render.md`. Read the matching reference for the command you're rendering:

- `/polycli:ask --provider minimax` -> `references/ask-render.md`
- `/polycli:review --provider minimax` -> `references/review-render.md` (Phase 3)
- `/polycli:rescue --provider minimax` -> `references/rescue-render.md` (Phase 4)
- `/polycli:adversarial-review --provider minimax` -> `references/adversarial-review-render.md` (Phase 5)

Command files (`plugins/minimax/commands/<name>.md`) remain the authoritative source of truth -- the reference docs capture cross-command patterns that wouldn't fit in a command file's frontmatter-bounded budget. When a command file and a reference disagree, the command file wins.

## Status taxonomy -> user-facing message

The companion maps Mini-Agent outcomes to a fixed status set (spec §4.1). Here is how Claude should open the message for each:

| Status | User-facing opener |
|---|---|
| `success` | (just present response verbatim) |
| `success-but-truncated` | "Note: response was truncated by model `length` finish reason." + response |
| `incomplete` | "The agent stopped with pending tool calls." + whatever partial response existed |
| `auth-not-configured` | "MiniMax isn't configured. Run `/polycli:setup --provider minimax`." |
| `config-missing` | "MiniMax config file is missing. Run `/polycli:setup --provider minimax`." |
| `needs-socksio` | "MiniMax needs the `socksio` Python extra. Reinstall with `--with socksio`." |
| `not-installed` | "Mini-Agent CLI is not installed. Run `/polycli:setup --provider minimax`." |
| `llm-call-failed` | "The LLM call failed after MiniMax's own retries. Check the log path shown." |
| `unknown-crashed` | "Mini-Agent crashed unexpectedly. Check the log path and rerun." |
| `success-claimed-but-no-log` | "Session finished but produced no parseable response. Rerun with `--json` for a diagnostic dump." |

Add diagnostic bundle (stderr head+tail) **only when the user has not already seen it in the companion stderr**. In `/polycli:ask --provider minimax` flow the user already sees stderr; just summarize.

## Unknown toolCall types

If companion returns `toolCalls[]` with an unfamiliar `name`, do not guess its meaning. Tell the user: "MiniMax returned a `<name>` tool_call that this plugin version does not render. Raw arguments: ..."

## Error output

If the companion returns an error status (non-zero exit), show it directly with context. Do NOT re-run automatically. Use the status -> message map above to choose the right user-facing opener.

## v1 status (Phase 5 complete)

All references in `references/` are populated and reflect Phase 1-5 actual behavior:

- `references/ask-render.md` (Phase 2)
- `references/review-render.md` (Phase 3)
- `references/rescue-render.md` (Phase 4)
- `references/adversarial-review-render.md` (Phase 5)

Token-usage story remains a v0.2 item — Mini-Agent currently doesn't surface token counts; do not claim costs.

## Non-goals

- Do NOT try to mask / redact response text. Redaction happens in `redactSecrets` at the companion layer before stdout writes. By the time Claude reads the stdout, secrets are already `***REDACTED***`.
- Do NOT cache/memoize responses across turns. Each `/polycli:ask --provider minimax` is independent.
