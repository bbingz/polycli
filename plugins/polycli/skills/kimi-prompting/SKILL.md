# kimi-prompting

Internal skill consumed by `polycli:polycli-provider-agent` and by the command files before
dispatching to `polycli-companion.bundle.mjs`. Not user-invocable.

## Scope

Guidance for Claude when composing a prompt to send to Kimi. Covers task
framing, output contracts, and the empirically-calibrated strict rules
that keep kimi's JSON output parseable.

## Universal rules

1. **Output contract first.** State the expected output format in the first
   paragraph of any task prompt. For JSON responses, explicitly say:
   "Return ONLY a JSON object matching this schema. No prose before or after.
   No markdown code fence." — positive-only instructions are treated as soft
   by kimi; include negative forms.
2. **Context in a labeled block.** When passing code / diff / docs, wrap in
   a clearly labeled XML-tagged section (`<repository_context>` /
   `<document>` / `<diff>`).
3. **Language parity.** Kimi's Chinese-language reasoning is strong. If the
   user prompt is Chinese, keep the meta-language (task framing, contracts)
   in Chinese too. JSON keyword enforcement stays English.
4. **Small `--max-steps-per-turn` on simple Q&A.** For `/polycli:ask --provider kimi`, a small
   N (1–3) prevents runaway tool-use loops. For `/polycli:rescue --provider kimi`, allow larger.
5. **No tool-call expectation in Ask.** Bias toward single-turn answers.

## When to invoke this skill

Any time Claude constructs a new prompt string to pass to Kimi through
`polycli-companion.bundle.mjs` (whether via `/polycli:ask --provider kimi`, `/polycli:rescue --provider kimi`, or inside
the `polycli:polycli-provider-agent` subagent). Especially needed when the prompt is user-
generated raw text rather than one of the packaged templates in
`plugins/kimi/prompts/`.
